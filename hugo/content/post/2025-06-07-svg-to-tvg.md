title: SVG To TVG
type: post
---

I am using [dvui](https://github.com/david-vanderson/dvui) in a project and it
uses [TinyVG](https://tinyvg.tech/) for its icon format.

While it sounds swell, most icons I could find were still
[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG).

When I tried to use a standard SVG, I got the following errors:

```
warning(dvui): iconTexture Tinyvg error error.InvalidData rendering icon craft at height 16

warning(dvui): iconWidth Tinyvg error error.InvalidData parsing icon craft
```

<!--more-->

I couldn't find a lot of resources online on how to convert an SVG file into
TinyVG.

On their [website, under tooling](https://tinyvg.tech/), there are links with
binaries for various operating systems.

I am not a fan of downloading binaries, but it seemed reasonable - maybe run it
in a [chroot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chroot) or container to be safe.

It needed two steps:

## Convert from SVG to TinyVG Text

```bash
./svg2tvgt <path-to-svg-file>
```

It will put the output in the same directory as the source file

## Convert from TinyVG Text to Binary

```bash
./tvg-text -I tvgt -O tvg <path-to-tvgt-file>
```

It will output the binary tvg file in the same directory as the source

## Repo & Status

The [SDK Repo](https://github.com/TinyVG/sdk) is using Zig 0.11 and hasn't had
an update in almost a year. There is a PR pending to update it to Zig 0.14,
which has been waiting a month.

It doesn't build on Zig 0.14 as it stands.

I worry that it might already be abandoned, but am hopeful that it will come
back to life.
