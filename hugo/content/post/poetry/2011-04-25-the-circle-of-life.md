title: The Circle Of Life
type: post
url: /2011/04/25/the-circle-of-life/
---

The circle of life,\
starting at zero,\
and all the way to infinity,\
to find that you are merely back,\
right at the beginning,\
at zero.

For I am nothing,\
Yet, I find that I am,\
I am everything.

In your soft hands,\
I am putty,\
Malleable, changeable, to be moulded,\
I could be everything,\
and I can be nothing.

Bend me,\
Break me,\
Shape me.

Breathe life into me,\
With but a simple kiss.

And I shall be yours,\
Not just for now,\
or this life,

For all life,\
All lifetimes,\
For eternity.
