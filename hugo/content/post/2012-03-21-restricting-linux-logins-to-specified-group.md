title: Restricting Linux Logins to Specified Group

If you have linux boxes that authenticate over ldap but want logins for specific
boxes to be restricted to a particular group, there is a simple way to achieve
this.

Firstly, create a new file called `/etc/group.login.allow` (it can be called
anything - you just need to update the line below to reflect the name)

In this file, pop in all the groups that should be able to login

```
admin
group1
group2
```

Edit `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` (in ubuntu), it might be
calledÂ `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` or something else very similar. At the top of
the file (or at least above other entries, add the following line:

```
auth required pam_listfile.so onerr=fail item=group sense=allow file=/etc/group.login.allow
```

For the record, found this little tidbit
[over at the centos forums](https://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=25940 "Allow Only Specific LDAP Group Access (CentOS Forums)")\
