Most of you know that I ran my own company for fifteen years, and at one point
it had around 30 people in five different teams. It was without a doubt the most
difficult job I've ever done by a long long way. It was also the most rewarding
and fulfilling.

Truth be told - it also very nearly killed me! I had a breakdown which left me
an emotional and mental wreck, as if I'd been hit by a bus (10 points if you
tell me which one!)

It has taken me the better part of 15 years to recover from that, and in the
meantime I tried working for others and I enjoyed it. In the end, though, I
think once you have run your own company for a while, it is incredibly difficult
to do anything else. It was inevitable that _if_ I ever got well enough, that I
would want to start something of my own again.

It was a long and hard journey, but I am _finally_ better, and I am ready to
start again. I am taking all the hard earned lessons into this venture, and I
want to do it even more differently this time.

I promised myself that this time around, I would:

- Surround myself with people who will challenge me and expand my perspective.
- Accept the fact that I do not have all the answers
- Do things the way that we are meant to:
  - Bring in expertise we do not have
  - Have someone in the team right from the start focused on marketing
  - Technically, BDD, TDD, Agile, Lean, ""The only way to go fast is to go
    well""
- Focus on people first
- Focus on the journey, not the destination

One thing I realised as part of this journey is that doing things differently
means that all the tools, technologies, and processes out there don't quite fit.

With #muster, we are starting with one of the easier parts, and streamlining the
developer experience. We are ending up building a lot of other things in the
process, but they all take longer.

With choosing to do things in a very different way, we don’t know exactly how
it’ll all pan out, but it will an interesting journey
