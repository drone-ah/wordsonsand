Since [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ "Firefox") 2.0, I have
never felt a desire to use
[Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx "Internet Explorer").
There have been times when I have used IE, either out of a need to test a
website on the browser or purely as the first step to downloading Firefox.

[According to W3C](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp "IE vs Firefox adoption"),
as of November 2008, IE(6/7) dominate 46.6% of the market with Firefox at 44.2%.
Compare this to November 2007 when IE (5/6/7) dominated 56% of the market and
Firefox only had 36.3%

It is interesting to
[note](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp "OS Statistics") that
between Nov 2007 and Nov 2008, Linux adoption (as far as internet browsing is
concerned) went up a meagre .5% from 3.3% to 3.8%.

This means that a very large proportion of the firefox users are from the
Windows Platform. Why is this impressive? There is technically no reason for a
user on Windows to download Firefox. Windows comes with Internet Explorer, which
should be adequate for all the internet browsing needs.

If 44.2% of all windows users went to the effort to download, install and use
firefox instead of Internet Explorer which comes pre-installed, let me ask the
question - if Windows came pre-installed with Firefox instead of Internet
Explorer - how many would go to the effort of downloading and installing
Internet Explorer.

While it is possible to install Internet Explorer on Linux, it might be a little
unfair to answer this question based on the number of Internet Explorer\'s
running off linux. People who run linux have proven to be biased against
Microsoft anyway, so it would be a loaded statistic.

While I have no doubt in my mind that Firefox is better than Internet Explorer,
I still don\'t feel that Firefox is perfect. It still feels far too bulky, with
disproportionate memory usage and it is still not as fast as Safari in terms of
page display.

Sure, the addons and themes functionality is great and useful. However, it would
be nice if it was faster to load, faster to use and just felt more
lightweight\... like Safari does\....

Having said that, I am **not** going to switch to safari. I like the browser but
it is still just **not** as good as firefox.

One of the points of open source software, should be to bring all the benefits
of all the competing pieces of software into one but it just doesnt work like
that. If Firefox had all the benefits of firefox as well as the benefits of
Safari, I am sure the adoption rate would be far higher\...

Lets take it one step at a time\... I vote for firefox feeling a lot quicker and
snappier for a wishlist\... :-)
