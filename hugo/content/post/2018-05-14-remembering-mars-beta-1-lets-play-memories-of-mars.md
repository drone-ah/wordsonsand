When I saw the
[game description on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/644290/MEMORIES_OF_MARS/),
I was intrigued. When they were giving out Beta keys, I volunteered and got
myself a key. Following are videos put together from maybe around 10 hours of
gameplay. Hope you enjoy

### #01 - Exploring Mars

 

Random wanderings, musings and exploration of Mars.

### #02 - Building a base

 

This is mainly the highlights of me figuring out and building a base on Mars :)

### #03 - Beta 1 Highlights

 

Highlights from around 6 hours of gameplay over the Beta 1 Weekend.
