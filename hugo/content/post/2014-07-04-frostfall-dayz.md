When it comes to gaming, my preferences seem to lie in the RPG Genre with
Strategy and Simulators coming in second. It is not often that I dabble in First
Person shooters. While I have some fond memories of the multiplayer mods that
came out of Half Life, I did not find myself curious about the
[features of Battlefield 4](https://www.playne.com/games/battlefield-4 "Features of Battlefield 4").

The
[features of DayZ](https://www.playne.com/games/dayz-standalone "Features of DayZ (Standalone)"),
on the other hand are interesting. While it doesn\'t really have any RPG
elements, it does seem to have unusual features and when the mod came out, it
was noticed for being different\... and difficult\...

My brother has been trying to get me to play DayZ for a little while and I did
try the mod a while back. I found it to be a bit \"too real\" to be really
enjoyable. From the near explosion of similarly themed games recently, it does
seem like a popular genre though\...

The new hunting and weather mechanics that they are talking about - particularly
the ones being compared to Frostfall in Skyrim is particularly interesting. I
thoroughly enjoyed playing through hardcore mode in Fallout: NV and the
Frostfall and the more complex needs of Skyrim.

The permadeath part of the game is unattractive for me though - but maybe one
day this will change..
