The other day I stumbled across Origin All Access and saw that it had a bunch of
games I wanted to play. One of these was Epistory, which had been in my wishlist
for a long time. When trying the game out, I fell in love with it. It is
absolutely a treat, so I decided to go through it as part of a let\'s play.
