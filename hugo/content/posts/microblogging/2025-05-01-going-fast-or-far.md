Aesop wrote us wonderful and valuable fables. Almost all of us know the one
about the tortoise and the hare - that slow and steady wins the race.

There is a quote by Mario Andretti:

> If everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough.

This one clearly embodies the hare, but is it a good attitude to have in all
work, or in general life?

We all seem to place so much emphasis on speed, it seems like we are trying race
through life. Aren't we all going to the same place?

I think the quote (of unclear origin)

> If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together?

is a good comparison of our options, and while it might be nice(r) to go far, I
think there is a lot more value in traveling together.

We are born alone, and we die alone. We do not have choice in those, but why do
so many of us go alone, just to go fast?
