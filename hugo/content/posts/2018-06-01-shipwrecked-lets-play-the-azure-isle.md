[I stumbled across this game on
[gamejolt.com](https://gamejolt.com/games/theazureisle/295076) and tried it out.
It sucked me in and I was smitten. See what happened.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

#01 - Shipwrecked

 

[We find ourselves shipwrecked on an island we don't recognise. Let's
explore]{style="font-weight:400;"}

#02 - Heading East
