title: Built Pong in Zig with raylib – part 1 (paddles, ball, setup)
type: reddit
---

I’ve been working on a bigger project in Zig for a while, but before diving back
into it, I wanted to build something small and self-contained to get back into
the rhythm - so I’m building Pong.

This is a build-along style series - figuring things out as I go. In part 1 I
get the project set up using raylib-zig, draw the paddles, the ball, and lay out
the playground.

I’ll be posting more parts soon - next up is ball movement and paddle collision.

It’s been fun so far.

I welcome any feedback you might have - learning as I’m going - only been doing
zig for a couple of months.
