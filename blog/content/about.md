My name is Shri, and online, I often go by the handle of @drone.ah (or some
variant of it).

I am many things and this site captures in words, some of the things that may be
capturable in words.

Feel free to get in touch

PS: The name drone.ah has nothing to do with drones. It's a pun. drone ah sounds
like [Drona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drona) and was intended to embody the
acharya, or teacher aspect. It suggested by my brother, and it became my handle
way before drones "were a thing."
