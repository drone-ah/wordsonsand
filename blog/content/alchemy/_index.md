title: alchemy, with shri
---

When the stakes are high, I bring the focus, momentum, and transformation to get
you where you need to go.

Most often, that looks like short, focused engagements where I come in, shake
things up, and leave your team with clarity, momentum, and lasting value.

## alchemy

{{< pullband >}}

_The act of transformation - and the value left behind._

Sometimes it's shaking up a team that’s stuck.  
Sometimes it’s refining a product until its core shines through.  
Sometimes it’s burning away the clutter to reveal what matters.

Alchemy is the work itself - and the change it creates.

The shape of the work shifts - but the intent is always the same: to bring light
into dark corners, surface real bottlenecks, and leave behind lasting value.

## with shri

I work alongside you, sleeves rolled up. My role is to cut through the clutter,
focus on what matters most, and leave your team stronger and clearer than
before.

## results

What remains after the work - the lasting value uncovered once the noise is
cleared.

When you bring me in, you’re not just hiring expertise - you’re getting
outcomes.

- **Resilience under pressure** - Turned around failing systems in days, by
  building an interim booking system for the Edinburgh Fringe ticketing platform
  in a single weekend - keeping thousands of customers online and the festival
  running.
- **Scale that works** - Architected and scaled megabus.com from hundreds to
  tens of thousands of daily orders across three countries - giving customers a
  reliable platform and the business capacity to expand.
- **Transformation that lasts** - At KFC UK & Ireland, improved delivery speed,
  resilience, and revenue by millions - while restoring trust between teams and
  leadership.
- **Startup to scale-up** - Built and shipped full-stack products in fast-moving
  environments, growing a company from 2 to 30 staff with 75% YoY revenue growth
  - giving founders the foundation to expand.
- **Innovation with impact** - From AI-driven recommendations to robust cloud
  platforms, designed and delivered systems that opened new product
  opportunities and revenue streams.

The result: clarity, momentum, and solutions that keep working long after I’m
gone.

## realise dreams

Every organisation carries ambitions that can feel just out of reach - faster
systems, stronger teams, ideas waiting to become real. My work is about helping
you bridge that gap: turning complexity into clarity, potential into progress,
and dreams into results.

Every organisation faces different kinds of challenges - from urgent fires to
long-term ambitions. To make it simple, I work at three levels of engagement:

### strategically (high-stakes transformation)

When the stakes are high and the pressure is on - failing systems, strained
teams, scaling ambitions - I step in to help steady the ship, align the people,
and deliver clarity out of chaos.

### tactically (focused, short-term projects)

Short, sharp projects that unlock progress. Whether it’s a health check, an
architecture blueprint, or a delivery reset sprint, these engagements bring
momentum and leave behind clear next steps.

### concretely (immediate, hands-on fixes)

Straightforward, fixed-fee offerings with immediate impact. A PostgreSQL
tune-up, cloud and pipeline optimisation, or a reset sprint - clear entry points
that deliver measurable results fast.
