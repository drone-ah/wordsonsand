YerToob is an app that I am developing to alleviate the tedium of uploading
videos to YouTube. YerToob works by automating large parts of the YouTube upload
process.

I currently upload a few videos a week and this involves:

- Copying and pasting various bits of text for:
  - The description
  - The title
- Copying and pasting in the tags, and adding any additional ones
- Scheduling the video
- Adding to playlist
- Generating and uploading a thumbnail
- Scheduling a tweet

YerToob tries to automate all of the above. It works by defining templates for
the description and the title using tags.

### Title Template Example

```
Ep[episode:number] - [episode:name] | [playlist:name] | Let's Play Space Engineers
```

---

### Description Template Example

```
[episode:synopsis]

---------

A lone space engineer wakes up in his small ship, far away from a home he once knew. There are only a handful of people still awake, with a few thousand people across a few factions in cryo-sleep. A capital ship is being built to house these cryo chambers. Several engineers have been sent out into the galaxies to build a base.

Their mission is to colonise planets, ideally multiple planets, for each of the three factions. With a few hundred to a thousand people in each faction. Once all the habitats have been built, the engineer is to send a radio signal and await the arrival of the cargo.

With the heavy burden of this mission on their shoulders, this space engineer wakes up, caught in the gravitational pull of a blue planet.

### Tags

There are a set of tags associated with each playlist and with each episode.
These are combined together and set against the video.

---

### Schedule

You can select which days of the week a video should be uploaded in each
playlist. You also select the time at which it should be published.

The app will then schedule them accordingly.

---

### Playlist

Each video is added to the relevant playlist automatically.

---

### Thumbnails

The app will pick up a screenshot from one folder, put the specified overlay
image on top, and then scan and overlay another image on top based on the
episode number. The thumbnail is then set against the video.

---

### Tweet

You define a tweet template:

```
#LetsPlay @SpaceEngineersG | Ep [episode:number] - [episode:title]|
https://youtu.be/[episode:videoId] | #pcgaming
```

Link up your Twitter account, and it will post that tweet at the scheduled time.

---

### Finding Videos to Upload

For each playlist, you specify which folder the app should scan for new videos.
Each video in that folder is then uploaded. Each video needs to be tagged with
an episode number. For example, the 50th episode could be:

```
[50] The 50th Episode.mp4
```

If you haven't already defined the episode details in the app, it will create a
new episode with the title of "The 50th Episode" by removing the episode number
tag and the file extension.

This can be useful if you don't have much episode-specific information.
