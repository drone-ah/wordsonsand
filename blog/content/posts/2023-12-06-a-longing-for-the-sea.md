title: A Longing for the Sea
---

One of my recently favourite quotes is:

> _If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't
> assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless
> immensity of the sea._  
> — [Antoine de Saint-Exupery](https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/antoine-de-saint-exupery-quotes)

In my mind, a good agile team works in this fashion. The team has a shared
vision, a goal and everyone is empowered to make choices they feel contributes
to progress to the shared goal.

With [my recent post on collaboration](./muster/2023-11-21-muster.md), I have
been thinking about how a concept like this applies within a truly collaborative
environment. In the quote, there is clearly a group of people and one of them
wants to build a ship. We do not know what the rest of the group desires. In the
context of traditional leadership, what the rest of the group wants is
importance mainly in the context of understanding how their wants and needs
align with those of the ones in leadership.

Within this context, collaboration is often seen as something the team does for
the purpose of achieving the goals or the vision set forth by leadership.

Having been through the gauntlet of various levels of company ownership and
levels of leadership, the only thing I feel I have ascertained is that I don't
really like any of it. In positions of leadership, the amount of responsibility
and pressure is immense and the higher up the ladder you go, the lonelier the
job is.

Being a team member with no leadership responsibilities is liberating. There is
a great deal of joy in being able to physically and metaphorically shut the
computer down at the end of the day and be done with the job. The rest of your
life is yours. The downside, on the other hand, is that I disagreed with (at
least) half the decisions made. With little power to improve the quality of life
of myself or my fellow team members — mainly because ultimately what was
important was the bottom line, not quality of life.

Which brings me to the question: **how do you build a collaborative environment
where the traditional boundaries of leaders and members are dissolved?**

I find the first challenge here is finding like minded people. Having the
motivation to build a highly collaborative team is only half the challenge if
the people in it are trapped in traditional team roles of member or leader — or
even worse, manager!

How easy is it to find someone able to see the possibility of a different way of
working when we have all been stuck in the rut of us vs them, infinite growth
and shareholder value? How easy is it to then learn to put aside our
differences, our childhood traumas and our baggage to be able to express our
authentic thoughts and desires without triggering our defence mechanisms or
letting our emotional baggage leak out? How much does it matter?

Hurt people hurt people, and humanity struggles to cooperate and collaborate
mainly because of our hurts — the ones we are unable to heal and recover from.
Because our hurts, particularly from childhood, are so strongly seared in us, we
see danger when anything close to our hurts presents itself. Like a soldier who
ducks and covers when they hear a car backfire — we all go into defensive mode
when something familiarly scary comes into our vicinity. Unfortunately for a lot
of us, we live in a world full of little triggers — some of which may be so
small that they are undetectable — but it impacts our mood and our ability to
reason.
