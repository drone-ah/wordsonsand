I’ve been working on a small indie game called
[_triangle_](https://drone-ah.com/2025/04/26/a-lonely-triangle/).  
It’s about depression, recovery, and resilience - things I’ve lived through and
am still figuring out.

## The Real Stuff Behind Making a Game

Making games is hard! Making games independently is harder. When you're doing it
solo, it's harder still.  
It’s juggling health, money, and energy - not to mention motivation.

I’ve spent over 20 years in tech, running a company, building stuff like
megabus.com’s ticketing system.  
After burning out and dealing with some tough health issues, I'm struggling with
even the idea of picking up freelance work or hustling like I used to. I have
about 3 months of money left, so I need to be smart.

On the positive side, I’ve got the experience - in dev and solo work - to see
this through,  
I just need to figure out a sustainable financial path.

## What I’m Doing Now

Here’s my current rough plan to keep _triangle_ moving without burning out:

### 1. Building Community

I've been posting devlogs and videos, but haven't really focused on building a
following or community. I loathe the "like and subscribe" crowd, so I don't want
to be doing that. I want to focus on adding value.

It'll take me longer, and that's ok - I have to figure out the finances, but
that's a separate problem.

I want to keep doing what I've been doing. Devlogs, videos, sharing and
collaborating. I'll have more time for a bit as well since the main project I
was working on has now been canceled.

I also want to make some improvements to this site to link things up a bit
better and make it a bit easier to find things. That'll have to happen on a
"little bit here and there" kind of basis though.

### 2. Going for Grants

I’m looking at funding from places like Creative Scotland that support mental
health and creative projects.  
_triangle_ isn’t just a game - I'm trying to express something real, and I’m
trying to communicate that clearly.

### 3. Maybe a Kickstarter

Further down the line, I might run a Kickstarter -  
but only if I can find the right piece of work that adds real value for everyone
involved: myself, the game, and potential contributors.

### 4. Patreon / Ko-fi - But No Paywalls

Once I have enough of a following / community (5k - 10k subs), I could set up
Patreon (and/or maybe Ko-fi), but no paywalls - I don't like them. I want to
invite people who want to support and join in, and participate.  
Everything stays public - devlogs, updates, builds.  
Supporters get perks like name credits and priority access.

### 4. Loans Only If I Have To

If I really need it, I’ll consider a small loan to get through a crunch -  
but only if it helps hit a real milestone, not just to stretch things out.

## Other Stuff I’m Doing

I’ve also started a coding video channel,
[_Shri Codes_](https://www.youtube.com/@ShriCodesHere).  
It’s a way to share bits of the process behind building _triangle_, maybe other
excursions and the things I’m learning along the way.

This blog is where I write devlogs, ideas, and rambling thoughts -  
it’s turning into a bit of a central hub that connects everything else I’m
doing. I have a bunch of other things that I've done in the past (and am working
on now) that I'd like to put on here as well. Of course, that takes up time too,
and I'm not sure how much real value that will add.

## If You Want to Follow Along

You're welcome to follow along on whatever platform works for you - no pressure,
no strings.  
I love collaboration and would really value your thoughts, whenever you feel
ready to join in.

If you have advice, experience, or just want to say hi, please do. It means a
lot. I'll take every bit of encouragement and support I can get.
