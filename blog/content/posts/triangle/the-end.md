It's funny how much can change in a moment. There was once a ship that was
happy. It had sharp edges and a soft soul. It loved feeling the cool sea breeze,
the mist as it flew close to the ocean. It loved the heat of the desert, and it
loved to watch the setting sun.

It loved to watch the birds, to race galloping creatures below, often pretending
to lose.

One morning, not unlike many others, it was resting atop a mountain watching the
sun rise, basking in the warmth of the sun and the twittering of the birds.

It's funny how much can change in a moment.

It was now drifting in silence surrounded by what looked like asteroids. The
warmth of the sun felt like a distant memory. How many moments had passed in
between? It did not know.

Beyond the asteroids, far in the distance, it could make out vague shapes.
Amongst them, one it almost recognised - a segment of a shattered sphere. The
ship recognised the ocean, now spilling into the black of space. It had once
felt the mist from that ocean, many years ago. It would not skim that ocean
again.

It slowly became aware of the structure - gargantuan, black, looming in the
dark. It hung weightlessly above what was once the ship's home, barely visible,
quietly consuming the remains. Methodically, mechanically, it tore through the
wreckage, scattering crumbs into the void - rocks, dust, fragments of what once
was.

The ship found itself drifting in silence surrounded by what looked like
asteroids.

There was no asteroid belt here before.
