[Krish](http://krish.blog.kraya.co.uk "Krish's Blog"), my little brother ;-)
recently
[wrote about HD](http://krish.blog.kraya.co.uk/2009/03/13/hd-oh-no/ "HD OH NO")
and I loved that article and agree with him wholeheartedly. Over the last few
days, I have watched a few movies... One of them was fantastic (saw it before),
couple were ok, and one was just awful.

The movie that I loved the most was Kung Fu Hustle. I had seen it before but it
was definitely enjoyable watching it again. Funnily enough, I didn't watch it in
HD (Although I recently got a HD TV) since it was on Film4 (which,
unfortunately, does not have a Film4 HD).

I have been thinking about what I love the most about the movie... Is it the
story? The story is great and I do love it but it is a simple story although it
does bring in humour, romance, action and edge of the seats suspense
fantastically well.

Would I watch it if it was a low budget movie with the same story? Absolutely!

It also has absolutely fantastic special effects. Absolutely beautiful. If the
story was not as good but the special effects was just as fantastic, would I
still watch it? YES!

I don't have surround sound (yet) but I suspect that the sound is absolutely
gorgeous with 5(/6/7).1. Would I watch a movie without as good a story or
special effects but it had such good sound/music? Not sure, but probably...

I am certain the movie looks better in HD but would I watch it without HD. Since
I didn't see it in HD, yes, of course I would. Will I watch it in HD? Hell Yeah!

I also watched "I married an axe murderer", this time in HD. Of course the fact
that i was in HD made no real difference to my viewing experience... I enjoyed
Kung Fu Hustle better (of course) but it was still a good enjoyable movie. God
bless Mike Myers

I also watched "Man Of The Year" with Robin Williams. Fantastic movie... Again
in HD. Again, didn't notice the HD part but I checked it side by side and the
quality was better.

I suppose it all comes down to what we take for granted and what we are used to.
With the big plasma tv's the image gets stretched a little too much and this is
noticeable. HD solves this. Of course 5.1 sound is beter than Stereo.

Before I go on, let me just mention the bad film I saw - it was Prophecy with
Christopher Walken. I could see the movie's potential. It has a good story but I
got bored halfway through - not because there were no special effects (I imagine
better effects through the movie). The story was not half bad (at least the
2/3rds that I watched). The acting was not bad either. In my view, the movie
failed to capture my attention for one very simple reason... Pacing... This is
not necessarily the movie's fault. We are now used to movies for the MTV
generation where everything moves so much faster. No, I am not talking about
cuts every 5 seconds. I am talking about the story moving forward. I watched for
a good 40 minutes or so, I still didn't know more than I knew at the start of
the movie. MTV generation or not, that is just boring...

I sincerely believe that everything has its place and a movie can be good just
because it has a fantastic story, fantastic special effects or fantastic sound.
It also needs to be delivered just right. Most importantly, for a movie to be
fantastic, you need it ALL!!! Thats what makes it a movie to be watched
repeatedly.

There are of course movies that buck this trend. The Big Lebowski is an
absolutely fantastic movie.

I have already seen this half a dozen times and I'll watch it again. In all
honesty though, if it "looked better". I'd probably watch it even more often...
Although, in all fairness, I am not sure **how** it could _look_ better but
that's not for me to worry about - I am not a filmmaker [yet ;-)]
