title: Will A.I kill America?
---

Will $500,000,000,000 in AI investment kill America?

Project Stargate: $500,000,000,000(i.e. $500b, the GDP of Singapore) in AI over
the next four years, starting with $100,000,000,000 (i.e. $100b, the GDP of
Bulgaria). https://lnkd.in/getadcFN

These numbers boggle the mind. The California fires have been estimated to cost
between $250b and $275b, which is just about half the total investment into
Project Stargate.

How much of this money is likely to be spent on mitigating bias? What about on
exploring the risks of AI? I don't mean AGI, Singularity, or about AI taking
jobs. I mean the day-to-day risks to ordinary people: the spreading of
misinformation and biases. We all saw the damage that Facebook and Cambridge
Analytica brought to the world. How much more damage could this cause?

How might these new tools be used to manipulate, control and oppress? How might
these tools further marginalise those who are already disaffected?

Yes, there might be fantastic breakthroughs, but at what cost?

I am somehow reminded of the poem "First they came...":

> First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out窶能
> Because I was not a socialist.
>
> Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out窶能
> Because I was not a trade unionist.
>
> Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out窶能
> Because I was not a Jew.
>
> Then they came for me窶能
> And there was no one left to speak for me.

The Manhattan Project, which built the first Nuclear bomb, cost $2 billion,
which, adjusted for inflation, comes to $27 billion. America wants to spend
almost 20 times that amount over roughly the same time on Project Stargate.

I apologise for the doom & gloom, but I have genuine concerns about the risks at
play here. How about you? Are you worried, excited or both?
