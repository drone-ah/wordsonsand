### Post-Exertional Malaise, Fatigue & Liver Health: My Experience and Insights

- **Initial symptom:** Extreme fatigue, heavy limbs, difficulty getting out of
  bed, worsening after even mild activity like walking.
- **Considered causes:** Post-exertional malaise (PEM), diabetes, electrolyte
  imbalances, dehydration, blood pressure issues, and liver dysfunction.
- **Liver tests:** Elevated GGT (~300) indicated liver stress, which may lower
  overall energy tolerance but doesn‚Äôt fully explain heavy legs or
  post-exertional crashes.
- **PEM characteristics:** Feeling better at rest, then crashing after modest
  exertion; heaviness in legs and delayed fatigue; symptoms worsen hours or even
  the next day.
- **Post-viral recovery suspicion:** GP suspects post-viral fatigue/PEM despite
  no recent confirmed viral infection.
- **Impact of salt and hydration:** Salt intake can affect symptoms like
  dizziness and heart palpitations; careful balancing needed.
- **Energy pattern:** Worst in the morning, improving through the day; matches
  liver function and electrolyte fluctuations overnight.
- **Management strategies discussed:**

  - Avoid pushing through fatigue (‚Äúboom and bust‚Äù cycles).
  - Pacing activity carefully to avoid crashes.
  - Rest and naps can provide temporary relief.
  - Gradual reintroduction of movement, monitoring for delayed symptoms.
  - Supportive diet and hydration adjustments, avoiding intolerances.

- **Key takeaway:** Symptoms likely stem from a combination of post-viral
  fatigue with PEM and underlying liver stress, requiring gentle pacing, medical
  follow-up, and self-monitoring.

## Supporting Liver Health with Real Food: A Practical Approach

Over the past few days, I set out to create a **fully raw, natural, and
nutrient-dense smoothie** to support liver health. The result? A satisfying ~800
kcal smoothie designed to serve as a **lunch meal replacement**, offering a
balance of **healthy fats, plant-based protein, fiber**, and
**antioxidants**‚Äîall from fresh, unprocessed ingredients.

#### Why Fully Raw?

I opted to avoid cooked or processed ingredients to maximise nutrient retention
and reduce preparation friction. Simplicity and shelf-stability (like using
frozen spinach or frozen carrots instead of fresh bananas) were key
considerations. I also swapped lemon juice for **apple cider vinegar**‚Äîeasier to
store and still beneficial for **bile production and digestion**.

#### Recipe Highlights

- **Avocado and olive oil** for healthy fats and satiety.
- **Chia, flax, and hemp seeds** for fiber, omega-3s, and protein.
- **Spinach, turmeric, spirulina** for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
  support.
- **Frozen blueberries and banana (or carrots)** for gentle sweetness and
  liver-friendly vitamins.
- **Unsweetened almond milk** as a clean, low-calorie base.

It‚Äôs a rich but balanced meal, and as a lunch replacement, it kept me full for
hours without any sluggishness.

#### Snack Strategy

I also explored shelf-stable snacks to complement this approach:

- **Roasted chickpeas**: Crunchy, high-fiber, protein-rich, and easy to make at
  home.
- **Pumpkin & sunflower seeds**: Great for liver health, but calorie-dense‚Äîstick
  to a small handful.
- **Nori sheets**: Surprisingly satisfying, low-calorie, and rich in iodine and
  antioxidants.
- **Nakd bars**: Convenient and natural, though a bit higher in natural
  sugars‚Äîbest used occasionally.

For **low-calorie satiety**, I found **raw vegetables**, **seaweed snacks**, and
**air-popped popcorn** particularly effective‚Äîespecially between meals.
