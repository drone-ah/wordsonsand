Java can be greedy with RAM. By default, it grabs up to half your system memory,
which is fine for serversâ€”but annoying on a dev machine.

You can tame this by setting:

```bash
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Xmx1G"
```

I dropped this into my .bashrc, and it instantly reduced background memory
pressure. One gig is plenty for most compile-and-run tasks during development.
