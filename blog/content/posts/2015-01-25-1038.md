title: "[UE4] Getting Sprint to work (C++)"

Getting Shift to sprint in the Unreal Engine 4 is very easy. There are
technically two ways of doing it.

- Change the scale down to say 0.5 and then increase it to 1.0 for sprinting
- Change the `MaxWalkSpeed` for walking and sprinting.

I prefer the second technique because it will keep the code simple enough and
continue to function as expected with analog controllers.

Lets start by adding the input action bindings

`Edit -> Project Settings -> Input -> Bindings` and add an action for **Sprint**
with **Left Shift** for the key.

All the code is in the Character class.

Within the header file, there are two blueprint variables for the `WalkSpeed`
and `SprintSpeed` so they can be modified easily.

We also override the `BeginPlay()` Method. This is used to default to Walking.

Add the following to your character header file

```cpp
/* The speed at which the character will be walking */
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = Character)
uint16 WalkSpeed;

/*_ The speed at which the character will be sprinting */
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = Character)
uint16 SprintSpeed;

virtual void BeginPlay();

protected:
/* Enables Sprinting for the character */
void EnableSprint();

/* Disables Sprinting again */
void DisableSprint();
```

Add the following to the constructor so we have defaults

```cpp
AMyCharacter::AMyCharacter(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer)
: Super(ObjectInitializer) {

    // Other code // Set the default Defaults ;-)
    WalkSpeed = 250;
    SprintSpeed = 600;

}

```

Plug in the Sprint action to the methods by adding the following lines into
the `SetupPlayerInputComponent` method:

```cpp
InputComponent->BindAction("Sprint", IE_Pressed, this, &AMyCharacter::EnableSprint);
InputComponent->BindAction("Sprint", IE_Released, this, &AMyCharacter::DisableSprint);
```

And implement the rest of the methods

```cpp
void AVSCharacter::BeginPlay() {
    // Ensure the player starts with Walking
    DisableSprint();
}

void AVSCharacter::EnableSprint() {
    CharacterMovement->MaxWalkSpeed = SprintSpeed;
    GEngine->AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 5.f, FColor::Black, TEXT("Sprintin"));
}

void AVSCharacter::DisableSprint() {
    CharacterMovement->MaxWalkSpeed = WalkSpeed; GEngine->AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 5.f, FColor::Black, TEXT("Walkin"));
}
```
