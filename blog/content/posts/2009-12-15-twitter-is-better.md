A little while ago,
[I wrote about my pet peeves to do with twitter,](/2009/03/09/making-twitter-bettermaking-twitter-better/)
and while they probably didn't read my specific ramblings, they have certainly
addressed my key concerns.

My biggest concern was of course, about security and twitter-apps. A little
while ago, I noticed that this has been resolved. Twitter is now linked with
applications in a more security conscious way. I love the way twitter now asks
if an application should be Â authorised to access information. Yay! No more
giving my twitter account details to third party websites.

I also covered an issue that I had with grouping users to see relevant tweets
together. This has also been resolved with the use of lists. In fact, lists have
changed how twitter works to an extent. There is a blog post about how
[lists will impact follower counts](http://corethinking.com/2009/12/13/how-twitters-new-lists-feature-will-dramatically-impact-follower-count/ "How twitters lists feature will dramatically impact follower count")
Lists provide a powerful mechanism to follow a group of people - now, if only I
could have an option to see all the tweets made my the people that I am
following as well as the lists - that would be cool. It probably should't be the
default, but an option to do that would be useful.

I also like the new feature where it tells you that there are new posts since I
last viewed a timeline - saves me from having to click reload randomly to see if
there are no posts. The little grey line differentiating the new posts help in
that I know how far down I have to read to see just the new posts... :-D
