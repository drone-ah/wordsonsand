So much of my life was spent running,\
away from or to something, I did not know.

Outside of life itself was existence,\
an adrenaline fueled ride into oblivion,\
a life envied, hated, admired, reviled!

A path of self destruction,\
collateral damage and catharsis.

Destroying everything and anything,\
that which was, is, could be, will not be..

Close to few, far from few…

Living fast, dying young...\
Anywhere but here,\
Anywhere but now…

Flying fast… into the mountains…\
and captured, not just attracted or found..\
but captured.

Slow as a snail now. Days go by too fast...\
Slow it down - anything to slow it down...
