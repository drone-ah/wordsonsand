Swimming around gently,\
for what seemed like an eternity,\
in what was but a moment,\
in her big brown eyes.

Time, with its ever changing moods,\
never stopping, \
always without mercy,\
I have myself a stay of execution.

Swimming in this warmth,\
this glow of love and affection,\
I am nary a man,\
nary a being of time or space.

In infinity I bask, in the glory,\
of simply being loved,\
by a heart that knows not,\
not what bounds are.
