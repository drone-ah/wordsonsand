a tiny little window of friendliness ... \
overflowing with hope and dreams,\
of just a possibility,\
a possibility that hearts shall not be torn apart.\
It leads us astray.. :-(\
try as we might to hold on to it.. \
it only ever seems to last but a moment.\
To live in that moment,\
it would be bliss...\
Even such a life would sure lead to boredom...\
and won't be long, will it be..?\
before the desire for a little more comes into play..\
only a little more..\
just a little more..\
cos now is never enough..\
for it is to be drunk\
to its fill\
and no more there is... to be drunk..\
and yet, I'm still thirsty..\
this unquenchable thirst.\
that shall be the kink in my armour\
my Achilles heel\
my weakest link\
but in the depths of your heart,\
your sweet tender soul\
runs a tiny a little stream\
and it flows into the an ocean \
an ocean so large and never-ending\
the universe itself sits quietly envious\
and I waited at the gates\
these tiny little gates\
so easy to jump over\
and yet I waited, patiently,\
and it seems like a thousand years have passed,\
or is it a thousand lifetimes,\
a million years, billion tears, a memory, a dream,\
I waited for you to open these gates\
and let me in so I may take a drink\
from this infinite and never ending ocean\
this ocean of love, joy, bliss and love\
that it may quench my unquenchable,\
infinite and never-ending thirst\
my thirst for more...
