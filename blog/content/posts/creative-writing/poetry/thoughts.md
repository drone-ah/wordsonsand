The thoughts that fill us daily\
Are the stone, the rocks\
The pavement, the roads.

These roads we pave,\
Sometimes with shit,\
Sometimes with silver,\
Perhaps with gold.

We pave these roads\
  With whatever we find,\
    With whatever we can afford.\
\
  But nothing changes the fact\
    The simple fact,\
      The destination is hell.\
\
  You can plant trees,\
    You can have butterflies,\
      Deer, birds and bees.

You can move in a car,\
  You can walk and\
    You can cycle there

It can be midday,\
  Or a moonlit night,\
Dusk or dawn,\
  It matters not.

The road you are on,\
It takes you to hell.
