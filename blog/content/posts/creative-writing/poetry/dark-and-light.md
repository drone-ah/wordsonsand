All around, as far as the eye can see,\
Nothing around but darkness,\
Not a flame in sight,\
Not a single light,\
No creatures bright.

Fear has gone missing,\
A glimmer of it only now and again,\
And it hides again.\
Every action certain,\
Every step sure.

Walking, running, crawling, \
always moving.

A moment, a day, a year, an eon,\
It all moved the same.

A glimmer in the far\
Growing faintly as I draw near.

Walking, running crawling,\
Always moving.

Light abound, as far as the eye can see,\
Nothing but light\
Shadows around,\
That and the memories,\
Everything else is light.

Standing a crossroad,\
Fear has been found,\
And it fills the light.\
All the courage I could muster\
Crushed under the weight of the fear,\
Ash in the light
