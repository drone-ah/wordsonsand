Sitting here quietly,\
At the railway station of life,\
Quietly watching lovers and friends,

As they say their fond farewells,\
As they pray for the train to be delayed\
so they may spend another minute together,\
just one more minute,\
just one more second.

As they wait with baited breath,\
For the train to arrive,\
So they may say their enthusiastic hello's.

I am not sad,\
that I sit here alone,\
for I love you,\
with all my heart,\
and it matters not,\
not a little bit,\
that you do not love me
