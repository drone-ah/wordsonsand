Who but you my love,\
Can brighten my day,\
The saddest of days,\
The hardest of days,\
The most frustrating days,\
With but a smile.

Who but you my love,\
Can make me feel rich,\
When I have lost,\
All that I had built,\
With my blood, sweat and tears,\
When you embrace me.

Who but you my love,\
Of all the people,\
In the whole wide world,\
Who but you my love,\
Can break my heart.
