As I draw in this breath\
I think to myself\
By my next breath,\
I shall love you\
Not any more\
For ever more.

As I see the sun set,\
I think to myself\
By the time the sun rises,\
I shall love you,\
Not any more\
For ever more.

As I see the sun rise,\
I think to myself,\
By the time the sun sets,\
I shall love you,\
Not any more,\
For ever more.

One more week,\
I think to myself,\
When this week is over,\
I shall love you,\
Not any more,\
For ever more.

One more month,\
I think to myself,\
When this month is over,\
I shall love you,\
Not any more,\
For ever more,

Just a year,\
I think to myself,\
By next year,\
I shall love you,\
Not any more,\
For ever more,

And now I lay,\
My life spent,\
In trying\
Not to love you,\
As I draw my last breath,\
I think to myself,\
When I am born again,\
I shall love you,\
Not any more,\
For ever more.

As I draw my first breath\
My first breath of new life,\
I think to myself,\
I shall love you,\
For ever more.
