There was once a time,\
when words flowed,\
like a river, yearning for the sea.\
simple words conveyed great meaning.

Words as simple as love,\
had a power...\
a power that was indescribable.

In the world of words, it was easy,\
easy to get lost and forget,\
forget the feelings,\
the memories,\
the thoughts,\
that they embodied.

I was never prepared,\
A time when words would fail me.

For there are some things,\
some rare things in life,\
that words cannot describe,\
words have not been created for,\
words cannot be created.

I would read the the dictionaries,\
not just of this tongue,\
but all that has ever been writ,\
to find but one word,

one word,\
to come close,\
to how much,\
just how much,\
I love you...
