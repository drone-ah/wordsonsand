Thank You, she said,\
Thank you for the dance.

Thank You, I said,\
Thank you very much.

For brightening my day with you smile,\
For making for forget my worries,\
To take me away from the illusion of this world,\
and into the depths of your eyes.

Thank You, I said,\
Thank you very much.

For freeing me from the shackles of this world,\
And liberating my heart and soul,\
When I love you as I do,\
I feel joy in everything I do.

Thank You, I said,\
Thank you very much.

For the pain that I feel that you are not mine,\
The sadness every time you walk away,\
The sorrow when you say goodbye,\
and the longing when you are away

Thank You, I said,\
Thank you very much.

For all the joy I feel when you are near,\
For all the pain I feel when you are far,\
For all the love I feel for you always,\
and I am grateful that I feel these for You.

Thank You, she said,\
Thank you for the dance.
