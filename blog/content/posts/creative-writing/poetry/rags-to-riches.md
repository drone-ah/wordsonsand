In a land of misery and pain,\
I grew up believing in fairy tales,\
In princes, princesses and happy endings.

In a land of sorrow and sadness,\
I grew up believing the words of rock n roll,\
I believed in fate, destiny, and happily ever after.

In a land of poverty and subservience,\
I felt wealthy beyond all comparison,\
I was rich with hopes, dreams and fantasies.

In a land of despair and regret,\
I grew up and moved away, far far away,\
To a land rich and happy, filled with marvels.\

In a land of wealth and influence,\
My dreams of fairy tales were dashed,\
I experienced misery and pain, day after day.\

In the land of princes and princesses,\
I learnt of music full of sadness and anger.\
I played the rhythm and the blues day after day, \
night after night.

In the land of independence and power,\
I felt trapped and powerless,\
Life was happening\
I fought against it\
I grew up,\
I lost

Then I met you!
