> ðŸ’¡ **Note**  
> The date of writing this is unclear. All I know is that it was before May 2007

I knew it my heart,\
even though I doubted it,\
now and again.

My love was not for a purpose,\
it simply was.

I knew this but I forgot.\

I wanted nothing back,\
I wanted nothing forward.

I just wanted to be,\
I just wanted to love.

It is easy to get confused,\
Who loves?

Is it me, my heart, my soul?\

Is it wrong that I miss her?\

To be with her fills me with joy,\
fills me with happiness,

Is that not selfish?

Should I not let her be?

Let her do what she wants?

as long as it makes her happy!

Indeed, but I still miss her,\
and all I want to do,\
is what I can to make her smile,\
to bring a little joy into her life.\
