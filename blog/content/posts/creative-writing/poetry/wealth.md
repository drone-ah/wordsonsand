All the riches in the world,\
Diamonds, jewels and gold.

Palaces with a thousand servants,\
Gardens with a million roses,

All the luxuries that money can buy,\
Or the ones that money cannot buy.\
Even to be a star,\
admired and loved by all.

None of this (if I had it) would compare,\
not even a little bit,\
to the happiness I feel,\
Every time I see you smile.
