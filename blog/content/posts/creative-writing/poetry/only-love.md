Imagine your heart, beating in your chest. \
It has two parts, \
Love is created in one,\
And recevied in the other.

See the love flowing from your heart,\
Redirect it all into the other part of your heart\
Watch as your heart fills slowly.

Donâ€™t try too hard, let it flow naturally.

When ready, let it overflow, slowly.

Let flow all over your body, cover your entire body with love\
Let it flow into your mind, cover all of it with love\
Let it flow into your entire being

Now, let it flow outside you,\
The barriers that kept that love inside you is gone.

In the middle of your heart is a tunnel that connects you\
It connects you to everybody whom you love\
Let the love flow.

The love within your being does not diminish.\
The newly created love replenishes any that is flowing out.

Let it flow out and it flows through the ones near you.

The love dances with the love from the others

Slowly, bit by bit, dancing, flowing, playing, all of the love merges together.

We are one, particles within an ocean of love.

We are no more, there is only the love.
