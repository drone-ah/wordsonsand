Shrouded in a cloud,\
Of mist, fog, haze,\
memories of roses,\
Pitter patter, pitter patter.

Holding me tight,\
A little too tight\
Holding me close\
Hold me closer

A drop rolls down my face,\
Another races to my chin,\
One is stopped,\
By upturned lips.

Is it today or tomorrow,\
Maybe it's yesterday,\
Is that the sun I see,\
Or is it the moon?

There's the roses again,\
Is that how rainbows smell?\
Pitter patter, pitter patter,\
All around me.
