title: A Half Written Poem
url: /2024/01/03/a-half-written-poem/
---

```
The middle of the night,
When the moon had eloped.

A cool breeze drifted,
sails fluttered,
leaves danced,
The sound of water lapping.

A boat inched its way to shore,
With nary a soul on board,
None that were still alive.

The hold overflowed,
locked behind a heavy door,

On the deck,
A half written poem,
Discarded and abandoned on the floor.
```
