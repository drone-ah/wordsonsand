My past that I didn't want to face\
and I kept running and running\
looking back now,\
I ran across some very unusual people\
some very unusual circumstances\
I never stopped\
Even when I smelled the roses, the coffee\
I still kept running

And now I see that I have reached the top,\
the very top of a mountain,\
and I see it all,\
the life I led.

Standing here looking down on the life I led,\
I can't help but feel a little envious,\
of the life that I myself led,\
looking back with the sun shining on my back\
and a tear in my eye

This accidental life that I led,\
all because I was running,\
away from something.

It might just be time.\
Time to face that past, \
that which I'm running from,\
And stop running

Standing at the edge of this cliff,\
perhaps its time,\
to let it all go.\

Perhaps its time to take a leap of faith,\
and let myself fly\
and for the first time,\
not away from something,\
not towards something...\
but to just fly..
