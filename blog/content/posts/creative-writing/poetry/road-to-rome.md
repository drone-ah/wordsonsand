It was just another day,\
or so it seemed…

The sun shone ever so bright\
on a soul dark and bitter…

Sipping another drag of nicotine,\
quaffing another shot of something strong,\
at least in the mind,\
of the soul still so dark and bitter.

The heat bearing down… \
trying its best to burn away..\
at least at the edges of the bitterness…\
and even the sun…\
could do very little…

The birds chirping tried…\
so did everything in its path..\
but none had any effect.

Then it encountered something unexpected…\
Hidden away in a corner of the world!

Something it had given up on finding…\
a time before time itself.

In a moment, \
lasting an eternity,\
it changed… \
everything changed…\
existence itself..\
was no longer what it was…

The energy, the optimism,\
the joy and love expressed..

Beyond words,\
inexpressible in action.

Even art fails to grasp\
that which happens in an instant.

Some call it love at first sight.

Other call it fate..

Others yet call it destiny.

I just called it my destination.

Everything conspired,\
sometimes cruelly,\
sometimes sweetly,\
sometimes stubbornly….

But as all roads once led…\
led to Rome…

All roads led me to you…

And time is suddenly moving too fast…\
Trying to slow it down,\
but time is more stubborn,\
than poor old me...

Two years, a lifetime, many lifetimes..

A brand new life - one barely imagined..\
barely contained…

Happiness discovered; love infinite...
