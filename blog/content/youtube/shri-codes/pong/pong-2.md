**In this episode of Building Pong in Zig with Raylib**, we get the ball moving
and dive into collision detection! ðŸš€

We pick up from where we left off â€” with two paddles and a stationary ball â€” and
start adding real gameplay:

- Add ball movement using velocity
- Make movement frame rate independent
- Implement basic x and y axis collision with paddles
- Get the ball bouncing off paddles using direction reversal
- Debug with paddle color changes to show collision points
- Tidy up edge detection for accurate hitboxes

This episode is all about laying the foundation for proper gameplay physics.
Itâ€™s unscripted, exploratory, and focuses on getting a working loop â€” no
perfection, just progress.
