In this episode, we're diving into **UI work in Zig** using **DVUI**, adding
**score display** to our little Pong clone.

Weâ€™ve already got scoring logic working behind the scenes â€” now it's time to
show it on screen. Along the way, I:

- Integrate DVUI into the game loop
- Set up score rendering for both paddles
- Refactor the game into its own struct with proper init and render/update
  methods
- Tidy up the build setup and improve code reuse
- Discuss feedback from Ziggit (shoutout to milo_greg!) around allocators,
  rendering quirks, and edge collision bugs

This is **part 5** of the Pong series, and while I had hopes of doing more, as
alwaysâ€¦ things take longer than you think.

Iâ€™ll cover the remaining polish and next steps â€” like handling sound, fixing
paddle-bounce bugs, and maybe input config â€” in a future video.

ðŸ”§ Built with **Zig**, **Raylib**, and a good dose of elbow grease.

Thanks for watching â€” feedback always welcome!
