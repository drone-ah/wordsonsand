**In this episode of Building Pong in Zig with Raylib**, we make the game
actually _playable_! üïπÔ∏è

We wrap up core gameplay mechanics by adding:

- **Edge collisions** - the ball now bounces off the top and bottom of the
  screen
- **Scoring logic** - players score when the ball goes past their opponent's
  side
- **Player input** - paddles can now be moved using `W`/`S` and `E`/`D` keys
- Debug lines and position logging to help track down weird bugs
- Ball reset and direction handling after goals

By the end of this video, we‚Äôve got a functioning, two-player Pong clone with
scoring and movement. Next up: showing the score, adding a menu, and
implementing win conditions.
