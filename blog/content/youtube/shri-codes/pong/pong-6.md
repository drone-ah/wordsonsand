In this episode of building Pong with Zig and Raylib, we fix some key bugs,
improve the score display, and refactor our game logic for cleaner structure.

üõ†Ô∏è **What we cover:**

- Fixing the paddle collision bug where the ball could get stuck
- Increasing the font size for the score using DVUI
- Improving score logic by moving it out of the paddle struct
- Cleaning up rendering based on paddle play area
- Discussing future plans for a pause menu

Thanks to feedback, especially from milogreg(from ziggit.dev), we‚Äôre tightening
up the gameplay and preparing for more features ahead!
