In this video, I start building a simple retro Pong game using **Zig** and
**raylib**. Before diving deeper into my main project ‚Äî _Triangle_ ‚Äî I wanted to
revisit the basics with something small, familiar, and quick to build.

We set up a basic Raylib project, draw the game field, and implement paddle
rendering from scratch. I also chat a bit about my workflow, project structure,
and where this is headed next.

üïπÔ∏è What‚Äôs in this episode:

- Setting up a Zig + raylib game project
- Drawing the paddles and the ball
- Some rambling and debugging along the way :)

This series is part of my devlog-style videos where I share the full process of
making games from design to code to polish (bugs and all).

If you're interested in **low-level game dev**, **retro game remakes**, or
**building games in Zig**, I'd love your company.
