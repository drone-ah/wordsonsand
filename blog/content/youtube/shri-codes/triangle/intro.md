🚀 **Welcome to shri codes!** In this video, I walk you through the early
development of my new game project: **Triangle** - a procedurally generated
space ARPG inspired by _Asteroids_, with crafting, physics-based combat, and
factory-building elements.

🛠️ Built using **Zig** and **raylib**, _Triangle_ blends classic arcade
mechanics with modern systems-driven gameplay. It's still super early, but I
wanted to share a first look at how it's shaping up - from basic movement and
shooting, to picking up materials, unlocking recipes, crafting ingots, and
queueing up builds.

📦 Key Features in This Early Build:

- Infinite scrolling space combat
- Material pickups and automatic smelting
- Unlockable recipes and constructors
- A build/craft system with item notifications
- Keyboard remapping support via config
- Modular codebase in Zig, using dvui and custom canvas rendering

💡 I also dig into the **code structure** - covering components like physics,
UI, crafting, inventory, save/load scaffolding, and how sectors define
procedurally generated levels.

🌱 This devlog marks the start of what I'm calling a **"Sprout" build** - a
seedling-stage version of the game I'm releasing into the wild. My plan is to
document the development journey openly - bugs, breakthroughs, and all.

🎮 Whether you're a game dev, a Zig enthusiast, or just into weirdly hopeful
games about triangles - thanks for joining me.
