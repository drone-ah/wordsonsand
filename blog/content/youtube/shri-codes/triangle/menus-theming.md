In this devlog, I keep building out the pause menu for _Triangle_ - my Zig +
Raylib arcade ARPG set in space. Itâ€™s not playable yet, but Iâ€™m getting closer.
This episode is all about adding **contact**, **logging**, and displaying the
**version + **config path\*\*. I spent a lot of time theming with DVUI (margins,
layout tweaks, etc.), and then went deep trying to make the config path
copyable - wrangling Zig mutability, DVUI widgets, and some quirks.

If youâ€™re into Zig, low - level UI fiddling, or watching a game slowly take
shape from scratch - this oneâ€™s for you.
