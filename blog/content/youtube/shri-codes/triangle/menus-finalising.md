In this devlog, I wrap up the core functionality of triangle‚Äôs pause menu. We
now have a working contact button that opens a browser, a clean way to show the
config path (copyable but not editable), and a fully functional, styled UI built
with Zig, Raylib, and DVUI.

This episode includes:

- Making the config path copyable
- Wiring up the **Contact** button to open a feedback form in the browser
- Dropping the **Logging** toggle (for now) after exploring custom log handlers
- Final cleanup and styling tweaks
- Merge into main ‚Äî the pause menu is officially done

This completes the pause menu milestone for the Seedling release. Next up: a
friendly notice screen with a version-aware changelog and roadmap.
