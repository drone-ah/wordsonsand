This one is a bit of a mixed one in that I didn't do it on my own. However, I
was the lead everything for. I ran the company responsible for building and
managing the ticketing system for megabus.com from its inception until 2012.

I lived, breathed and loved megabus for 9 years. Whenever my girlfriend at the
time asked me what I was thinking - the answer was inevitably megabus.

It nearly killed me. When I talk about [burnout](/tags/burnout) - megabus was
the main culprit.

I still have the code for the final iteration of it, which was a
[Java EE](/tags/java-ee) ticketing system.

I don't think I have the code for the original php based system anymore.

If there is some interest, I'll consider sharing the code, albeit it was last
updated in 2015.
