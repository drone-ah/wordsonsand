While working on [drone ah adventures](./drone-ah-adventures.md), I got pretty
sick of setting up all and uploading all the youtube videos.

I spent a few weeks putting together a quick app to do that for me.

I build it in [javafx](/tags/javafx) and it was far too clunky in the end. I dug
it out, but it doesn't compile anymore.

I'll fix it and make it available, at some point
