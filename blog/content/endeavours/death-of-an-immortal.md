On a few hungover mornings, occasionally heartbroken, other times merely
inspired, I wrote [a handful of short stories](/tags/death-of-an-immortal)

Many years later, I sat down and expanded it out into a novel size story. As my
first writing venture, it is far from ideal. I clearly loved exposition and I
probably go through enough story there to cover a handful of novels rather than
one.

In my mind, there were at least two more such exposition filled books yet to
come. Alas, I ran out of steam and motivation and all that is left is this one
book.

I will find it and include it here
