After watching many a youtube gaming video, I wanted to do a channel of my own,
and I did for a while.

## Space Engineers

[The Pilot Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqmD4lVTGM&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUzyM-bJllq3QpWdVGDBhC98&pp=gAQB)
I still have the last video or two, which I never got around to uploading

[Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_075xAh0VNM&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUz61gNb9AJQrVfri4qZp0Jd&pp=gAQB)

Just the one tutorial video

## Subnautica

[Wet Feet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZmipiqFrYs&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUy4sWwpo8T68bm_kpiKlm-4&pp=gAQB)

I got too scared to be able to finish this one

## while True; learn()

[First Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PByyKwJ-ouY&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUxe7N6CETzEuUOT7YTljiOS&pp=gAQB)

Played when it was still pretty early. Run was terminated by a bug.

A lot of the levels also got changed and I was never quite motivated to go back

## Memories of Mars

[Beta 1 Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIR0-AWW1I&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUzAMEOWsfxUmoWwV9Y4AjJn&pp=gAQB)

Cut together videos of the beta gameplay.

## Epistory

[Unfolding the Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKUZZtMtFCk&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUyMfxpPKw7lYEcxK6KQGc8G&pp=gAQB)

A beautiful game and a lovely story - one that I finished on here

## Playne

[Daily Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb29g5tzE5Y&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUzLfpda98zPG2Em7sc-jMvE&pp=gAQB)

I think I got 30 consecutive days of meditation with this awesome game

[Revisiting Playne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnlL2XW3kEk&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUwkwvzkfSwJYB-uZ89nCqsf&pp=gAQB)

Another couple weeks of meditation

## The Azure Isle

[Shipwrecked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxzlaGvhM-c&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUzEMftIdH-weiRSu6bnEVik&pp=gAQB)

I loved this little game, but I got stuck!

## Slay the Spire

[Clambering the Spire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJhu7fEZ46I&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUz5SSCcnkbkwb1Yl0FrNc0Z&pp=gAQB)

Loved this game - I might not have gotten round to uploading the last video

## XCom Chimera Squad

[Exploring City 31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFa1PxCbdJ0&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUy1_V5sOrJVmSDCT6JwYw2o&pp=gAQB0gcJCWMEOCosWNin)

A great game, but I got distrated.

## Book of Demons

[Deck Building Diablo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFY9zYwrUSg&list=PLQb-fOWHIdUyWIwxTOUK_XiUY3_N3D0W1&pp=gAQB)

I enjoyed this one for a little bit
