triangle is a minimalist arcade ARPG set in an endless asteroid field. You pilot
an indestructible ship, scavenging resources and building every upgrade from
scratch - no loot, no grind, just pure progression.

Inspired by Asteroids, ARPGs like Last Epoch, and factory games, triangle blends
fast-paced combat with deterministic crafting and a focus on flow. There are no
tutorials - just intuitive design, thoughtful feedback, and space to explore.

At its heart, itâ€™s a quiet metaphor for recovery: from black-and-white
beginnings to vibrant growth, you always survive - and you always rebuild.
