There once was a boy,\
And the boy was not afraid.

He looked out at the world,\
Everywhere he looked,\
Everyone he knew,\
Led their life carefully,\
Moved through crowds cautiously,\
Stayed far from the ledge.

It took many years,\
Jumping off many cliffs,\
Chasing butterflies,\
Breaking his little heart,\
many, many times.

He understood the fear,\
He felt it as he lay on the floor,\
cradling himself,\
Afraid to open the door,\
Afraid to get up,\
Afraid to breathe,\
Letting the darkness take him.

The fear permeated him,\
Every pore, nook and cranny,\
A darkness with no beginning,\
A darkness with no end.

Forsaken!

Cold!

Afraid!

Alone!

Flicker,\
Flicker,\
Flicker,\
Hope.

Step\...\
Step\...\
By,\
Step\...

Into\...\
The light.

There once was a man,\
And he was brave!
