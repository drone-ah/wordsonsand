Found this video of an
[entire skyscraper being destroyed](http://www.gamecupid.com/game-feature/4356 "Destructible World in BattleField 4")
in
[Battlefield 4](http://www.gamecupid.com/games/battlefield-4 "Features of Battlefield 4").
My! things have moved on a fair bit in the world of computer games. Here I was
enjoying the lush scenery of
[Skyrim](http://www.gamecupid.com/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim "Features of Skyrim")
and all of a sudden, an entire world that can be destroyed?

It is a shame that with all of this power, some of the features I have really
enjoyed in games like witty banter with your companions (The Baldurs Gate series
being a very good example) are still so sorely missed. :-(
