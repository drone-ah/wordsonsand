<p>I am involved in the beta testing for playne, a meditation game. While I had meditated many many times in my life, I had never done it consistently. That is, until Playne.</p>

<p>#04 - Layers of the mind</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mind is like an onion - so many layers and it makes you cry.</p>
<p>#05 - Level 2</p>
