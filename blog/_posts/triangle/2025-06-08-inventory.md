The next gap that needed to be addressed was a rudimentary inventory system.

Here is one, filled with icons:

![full inventory](/assets/triangle/inventory/full-inv-grid.png "full inventory grid")

This screenshot was taken when I was just putting the same icon in there in
repeat to test whether it works.

Here is one with a single actual item in the inventory:

![inventory with single item](/assets/triangle/inventory/single-inv-item.png "a
lone item in the inventory")

Obviously lacking any polish and is only a functional proof of concept.

I also set up notifications for items being added to the inventory.

![notifications for inventory](/assets/triangle/inventory/inv-notifications.png "show notification on add to inventory")

I wanted a better icon for the inventory button and found a reasonable one that
was in SVG format, but [I had to convert it to TinyVG]({% post_url
