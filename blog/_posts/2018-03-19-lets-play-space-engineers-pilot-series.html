<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have been watching gameplay videos on youtube for a while now. I have always been inspired by them and wanted to start a series of my own.</p>
<p>I hadn't played space engineers for a few months and had been wanting to go back to it. That made it an ideal candidate to try this on. One thing I always struggled with Space Engineers is that it doesn't have a goal to work towards. To this end, I have tried to come up with a backstory that'll give something to work towards</p>
<p>It was substantially more difficult than it looks to talk and play a game and the first couple of episodes are incredibly stumbly. I share them for posterity, continuity and hopefully to also show how much improvement there is later on, hopefully.</p>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>A lone space engineer wakes up in his small ship, far away from a home he once knew. There are only a handful of people still awake, with a few thousand people across a few factions in cryo-sleep. A capital ship is being built to house these cryo chambers. Several engineers have been sent out into the galaxies to build a base.</p>
<p>Their mission is to colonise planets, ideally multiple planets, for each of the three factions. With a few hundred to a thousand people in each faction. Once all the habitats have been built, the engineer is to send a radio signal and await the arrival of the cargo.</p>
<p>With the heavy burden of this mission on their shoulders, this space engineer wakes up, caught in the gravitational pull of a blue planet.</p>
<h2>Episodes</h2>
<p>Below are the episodes already uploaded to youtube.</p>
<h3>#01 - Hunting for Uranium</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/GOqmD4lVTGM</p>
<p>In the first episode, we start in a respawn ship within the gravitational pull of Earth. We then move off into space and go hunting for uranium before we run out of power. The most excitement came when I realised that I was running out of oxygen and I hadn't taken a canister with me. Will I die from suffocation? Find out ;)</p>
<p>This is a very noob video, my very first. Also, due to a recording mistake, there are no game sounds on this video :(</p>
<h3>#02 - Starting a Base</h3>
<p>https://youtu.be/7qVowX5whJ4</p>
<p>We identify a location to start our base out on and start building it in earnest. Partway through, I realise that the scaffolding that I had painstaking built out was way too large, so I tear it down and try to build a small base. I also spend some time mining out a bunch of iron.</p>
<p>This is also a very noob video, though I think there are fewer boring parts (hopefully). The game audio issue is also fixed part way through.</p>
<h3>#03 - Furnishing</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/m5Enko3Sxxg</p>
<p>This episode revolves around finishing construction of some of the items inside the base. There was some confusion about how to build a cargo container without dismantling the one on the ship.</p>
<p>This is hopefully starting to get a little better.</p>
<h3>#04 - More Furnishings</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/oqEjvVypnlI</p>
<p>Realise that I am running out of oxygen (again) and we don't have an Oxygen Generator or Ice. Fix that first, then build a turret for some protection.</p>
<p>I felt this episode was a lot better.</p>
<h3>#05 - The Bug</h3>
<p>https://youtu.be/QXClJZm9Hb0</p>
<p>This episode starts with building a rudimentary mining ship which I screw up. I had been away from this game for a while ;) I then fix a bunch of the stuff, do some mining, then fix a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>This episode also felt pretty ok to me.</p>
<h3>#06 - The Shredder</h3>
<p>https://youtu.be/3w1T7pClos0</p>
<p>In this episode, I build a grinding ship. I then use this ship to grind down the original respawn ship completely. I also reconstruct the roof of the base to be a little tidier. The rest of the episode is spent scouting for resources.</p>
<p>It feels like I need to commentate more. While editing, I realise that there are a few unexpressed thoughts and the sheer amount of time when I am not saying anything still surprises me. A lot more work still to do :)</p>
<h3>#07 - The Digger</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcBFEOzxyEQ</p>
<p>We build another version of the miner, so that we don't have to deal with the container snafu 'bug' ;) This episode runs a little longer, but we end up with a much better version of the miner which I call the digger. This is a callback to <a href="https://www.genomised.com/games/digger">a game that was released in 1983 </a>which I loved growing up :) You can <a href="http://www.futrega.org/digger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try it online.</a></p>
<p>I feel that the videos are definitely improving and look forward to hearing what you think :)</p>
<h3>#08 - Tim is in Charge</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/6NCFKtMxRnQ</p>
<p>Tidy the base up a bit, plugging the reactor into the conveyor system. I then set up Talendan's inventory management (TIM) to automate the refinery, assembler and the inventories. Set up some LCD panels to see the status of these as well.</p>
<h3>#09 - Base Expansion</h3>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmEuCeQu8U&amp;index=9&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLQb-fOWHIdUzyM-bJllq3QpWdVGDBhC98</p>
<p>Fix a couple of things on the base and start on expanding it.</p>
<h3>#10 - The Mole</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Build a tiny mining ship using the Vertex Thrust 2 Script. This doesn't go exactly according to plan.</p>
<h3>#11 - The Refinery Room</h3>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiqFMIspVHU</p>
<p>Get the framework for the refinery room more or less complete</p>
<h3>#12 - The Beaver</h3>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7-unJTywWo</p>
<p>Most of this episode was spent trying to build a small and compact enough welding ship.</p>
<h3>#13 - The Refinery Room Pt 2</h3>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsMY4q_hBHw</p>
<p>We weld up the refinery room and link it up to the rest of the cargo network.</p>
<h3>#14 - Misbehavin' Tim</h3>

<h3>#22 - Ant Mk II Better Automated Miner</h3>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvLNVdIRlkg</p>
<p>While falling asleep, I had some ideas on how to improve the Ant. I get on with constructing the Ant Mk II.</p>
<h3>#23 - Testing the Ant Mk II</h3>
<p>https://youtu.be/WhtVJZxtj3E</p>
<p>Wait, why does the ship try and drill through the asteroid sideways?</p>
<h3>#24 - Ant Mk II Chassis</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We build the Chassis around most of the Ant, send it off mining and start working on airlocks.</p>
<h3>#25 - Rotary Airlock</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Put in Airlocks and start on getting the base airtight.</p>
<h3>#26 - Airtight Refinery Room</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We manage to get the refinery room airtight? What was the problem - something I had done right at the start of setting the room up.</p>
<h3>#27 - Fully Pressurised</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Fix the autominers so they work across reloads. Get the base fully pressurised and move on to the next project.</p>
<h3>#28 - Holey Cave</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>What I wanted was to have the new section to be mostly just rock, or in this case, iron deposits. Do I manage to get it airtight?</p>
<h3>#29 - Unholey Cave</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Working on making the way to the hanger airtight.</p>
<h3>#30 - Fixing Sim Speed</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Space Engineers had been dragging for a few episodes. Fix that.</p>
<h3>#31 - Way to the Hangar</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We make progress building our way towards the hangar.</p>
<h3>#32 - Building a Tunnel</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Building the tunnel that'll take us to the Hangar.</p>
<h3>#33 - Finishing the Tunnels</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We finish off the tunnel to the Hangar</p>
<h3>#34 - Under the Stairs</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We start furnishing under the stairs ;)</p>
<h3>#35 - Starting the Hangar</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We make our way to the hangar and start on it in earnest.</p>
<h3>#36 - Hangar Foundations pt 1</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We start putting in the struts that will hold the hangar together</p>
<h3>#37 - Hangar Foundations pt 2</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We continue our work in putting in the struts around the hangar</p>
<h3>#38 - Small Steel Tubes</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>While putting in the tubing around the hangar, we run out of small steel tubes.</p>
<h3>#39 - Automining Without Lag</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Try and get the autominers working without lag.</p>
<h3>#40 - Faster Mining</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Try and speed up automatic mining by attaching several more drills.</p>

<p>One by one fail by fail. At least, that's how it felt.</p>
<h3>#45 - Fixing Things</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Try and fix everything that broke in the last episode.</p>
<h3>#46 - Making Space</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Making more space inside the large grid ship to put things.</p>
<h3>#47 - Interior Design</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So... What should go inside this brand spanking new ship?</p>
<h3>#48 - No More Gold!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We run out of gold while building the jump drive.</p>
<h3>#49 - Detaching the Ship</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We grind off the supporting beams. Will the ship crash and burn?</p>
<h3>#50 - The Big Five O</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The fiftieth episode of this series. My first ever YouTube series and it has got to 50 episodes. Hurrah!</p>
<h3>#51 - Interior Redesign</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I start off with the intention of finishing off the hanger, but end up grinding the whole hangar down.</p>
<h3>#52 - Rebuilding the Hangar</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We get back on to the hangar and get most of it down</p>
<h3>#53 - The Right Wing</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>No, it's not a political episode, it's about building the wing on the right hand side of the ship.</p>
<h3>#54 - Out of Cobalt</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Working on the right wing and I run out of metal grids, which as it turned out was because we were out of Cobalt.</p>
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>The main next plan is to flesh out the base a bit and get a solid starting point. After that, we'll go to the moon. We'll build a moon base with a habitat of some form.</p>
<p>If I am not bored after that, I might try heading to Mars or the Alien planet since I've not been to either of those locations.</p>
<h2>Unlikely but would be awesome</h2>
<p>In an offline map, kaljack and I were working on building a massive capital ship with hundreds (or thousands) of cryo chambers. The idea being that this ship would contain the remaining people from a now dead civilisation. They are looking for a place to land and call home.</p>
<p>The habitats and the environments we are building are for these people. If we ever finish that capital ship, we'll get it jump into our world and land on one or more of these locations.</p>
<h2>Finally</h2>
<p>I welcome comments, ideas and thoughts, ideally in the form of compliments ;) but I also welcome constructive criticisms, ideas, questions and requests.</p>
