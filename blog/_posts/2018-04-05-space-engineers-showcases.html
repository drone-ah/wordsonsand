<p>Here we have some of the items I have showcased</p>
<h2>Ships</h2>
<h3>Big Bertha - Leviathan Mining Ship</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I got tired of the multiple mining trips I had to do. This frustration led me to build this large mining ship. It took me several hours and more steel plates than I could count. Hope you enjoy this tour</body></html></p>
