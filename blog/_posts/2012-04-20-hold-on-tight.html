<p>Hold on tight,<br />
To everything,<br />
Just hold on tight,<br />
for you don't know when,<br />
when it might all go,<br />
when it might all disappear.</p>
<p>Hold on tight,<br />
for one day,<br />
it will go,<br />
it will disappear.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But not today,<br />
Not right now,<br />
not if I can help it.</p>
<p>For tomorrow,<br />
Realise that it is gone,<br />
and not for a moment or a day,<br />
but for ever.</p>
<p>And I might resent that which,<br />
that, which,<br />
which slipped away,<br />
while I held on to these hot coals.</p>
<p>Scars are but I have left,<br />
but not from that,<br />
not that which I desired,<br />
but that I didn't,<br />
that which I couldn't,<br />
I just...</p>
<p>Told once not to,<br />
Don't give life your all,<br />
Not if happiness is seeked,<br />
Not within the confines,<br />
Not happiness in the life,<br />
Not the life you know,<br />
Not the life you understand.</p>
<p>So I held on,<br />
To the net,<br />
The safety nets,<br />
Not just one,<br />
But all I could.</p>
<p>And yet, ripped,<br />
Not just away,<br />
Not just apart,<br />
All the nets,<br />
If not in life,<br />
then in death.</p>
<p>To live a life,<br />
As alone as it will be,<br />
For nobody,<br />
To throw away,<br />
To discard their nets,<br />
Their safety nets,<br />
In life, and walk.</p>
<p>Along the edge,<br />
Where with a hello,<br />
and Â a how do,<br />
life meets death.</p>
<p>To die is to live,<br />
To live is life,<br />
But if happiness you seek,<br />
Happiness confined,<br />
Happiness from another,<br />
Don't take the leap.</p>
<p>Just hold on tight...</p>
