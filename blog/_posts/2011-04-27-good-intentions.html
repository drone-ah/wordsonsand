<p>And I walk down this path,<br />
Paved with gold and silver,<br />
And the colours of the rainbow,<br />
Paved with nothing but good,<br />
No, the best... of intentions...</p>
<p>Right into the heart of hell.</p>
<p><!--more-->It takes time to walk this path,<br />
Patience, they say is a virtue,<br />
But one day, I will get there...</p>
<p>I watch the butterflies,<br />
The red roses,<br />
And theÂ chrysanthemums,<br />
As they lean towards me,<br />
As if to try and get away,<br />
From the gates of hell...</p>
<p>With each step, as I get closer,<br />
I taste the air get more arid,<br />
Just a little, only a little,<br />
Barely noticeable...</p>
<p>And I watch the butterflies<br />
As beautiful as a rainbow,<br />
Glimmering ever so bright,<br />
As they turn into moths,<br />
As dark as the night sky,<br />
Not even a sliver of light,<br />
For there is no moon.</p>
<p>The flowers,<br />
With the undeniable,<br />
Their unforgettable fragrance,<br />
Swaying softly in the breeze,<br />
Inviting me into a world,<br />
A world of joy and fun,<br />
As they turn into death,<br />
Into the dark branches,<br />
That once held the beauty of all life...</p>
<p>The gate ever so wide open,<br />
One does wonder, but quietly,<br />
Why there are gates at all...</p>
<p>Walking through, I feel the heat,<br />
It burns my skin, but slowly,<br />
I feel myself burn away,<br />
Slowly and with passion...</p>
<p>Sparks fly enthusiastically,<br />
Playing with each other,<br />
like lovers on a moonlit night.</p>
<p>When all is done and said,<br />
I see that my heart is still beating,<br />
The fires licking it, kissing it tenderly,<br />
Coaxing it, ever so quietly and gently.</p>
<p>Join us, in this eternal fire,<br />
This fire of infinity,<br />
Burn, and for ever,<br />
Be for ever a part of this.</p>
<p>But my heart denies the fire,<br />
An eternity, an instant,<br />
A drop of blood,</p>
<p>A small drop of blood,<br />
floats down into the fire.</p>
<p></body></html></p>
