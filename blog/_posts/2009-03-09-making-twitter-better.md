I think that twitter is a fantastic service and has a bright future. However,
like a lot of new things, the question of whether it will flourish or perish is
really all down how the growth is managed, planned and executed.

I should point out that I don\'t know the people at twitter at all and is very
much an outsiders opinion. I have been running a business for about nine years,
and while it is of nowhere near the success of twitter, I\'ve definitely learned
some hard lessons. I am not complaining - I am however, voicing some ideas on
how things could be made better.

My experience also includes working very closely with megabus.com, which grew
from a fledgling website 6 years ago to what it is today servicing over a
100,000 visitors every day.

My gut instinct about Twitter is that the guys and gals are working hard to
delivery one really good service really well. However, it is of a size now where
service delivery should be happening in the background with little or no effort.

When megabus.com first launched and over the first couple of years, we spent a
lot of time managing the hardware, software and processes till we got it right.
It went through a dramatic re-architecture in 2005 and since then, the
management time has dropped dramatically.

To take twitter to the next level so that it can be bigger than facebook, in my
opinion, requires twitter to a lot of things:

**Reliability & Performance**

I don\'t know the architecture / infrastructure of twitter but having used it
fairly heavily over the last few days, have noticed intermittent outages. This
has to be solved. Not just in the short term, but in the medium and long term.
Twitter has to be a service that just works. All websites suffer glitches and
outages but the mean time to failure needs to be a lot higher and it should be
cheap and cost effective to scale.

**TwitApplications**

There are a lot of services and applications that link into twitter. I
consistently use tweetburner, tweetdeck and have looked at / considered a range
of other services / applications. While the wiki page can point someone in the
right direction. This needs to be integrated better into twitter itself

Facebook really took off and removed bebo and myspace as competitors, in my
opinion the day it introduced facebook applications.

It should be a different process from facebook as facebook applications are of a
different breed and different target market. Twitter simply needs to make it
easier for applications to integrate in to solve two problems

1.  Easy launchpad to add them in and use them
2.  Remove the need to provide the twitter username/password in other websites.
    I currently have to do this with tweetburner to post directly which makes me
    very uncomfortable.

**Accessibility**

I am not talking about makes it easier for people with disabilities to access
the site. I am talking about people who are not technically savvy or more
importantly twitter savvy.

I joined twitter a while back and just felt a bit lost. There was no guidance as
to what a tweet was, what it meant to be a follower or what it meant for people
to follow you.

It took an article on a magazine explaining it to make it easier for me to
understand and re-boot my twitter life.

Help & Support are good and useful but it should not be necessary if the help
and support is present throughout the site. Facebook does this well and makes it
easy to learn and do new things. It does not need to be idiot proof but it does
need to have just enough information for a newbie to get started.

There are numerous blogs, articles and websites that cover this information but
that means that someone has to spend enough effort getting out there and finding
out.

This can be difficult when you don\'t know what you are searching for as well.

**Functional Integrations**

There are several integrations that would be useful. There are websites that do
some of these things but it would be useful to have them integrated within the
site. Examples include:

- Easy way to see the last tweet of all the people you are following / your
  followers
- Popularity of the people you are following / your followers
- Group people, so that you can follow people who blog about different things
  but read them together

**Conclusion**

From my perspective, this is of course a starting point, the tip of the iceberg.
Twitter is involved in a lot of new things but without the soft aspect, I think
it is making its life harder than it has to be to get the masses.
