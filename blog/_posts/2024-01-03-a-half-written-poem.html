<p>In the middle of the night,<br>When the moon was gone.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The gentle breeze caressed my face,<br>Pregnant with salt, cool to touch.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fireflies glowing with all their might,<br>And lighting up barely nothing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A boat slowly made its way to shore,<br>With nary a soul on board,<br>None that was still alive.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The hold though, was overflowing,<br>Food, wine, silks and fine leather,<br>Not to mention all the gold and silver.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of value on the boat,<br>There was but one small thing,<br>A half written poem,<br>Discarded and abandoned on the floor.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><br />
