<p>The first phone I ever got was a Motorola Startac 70. This was back in 98 or so, a flip phone and I still remember it ever so clearly!</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure my next phone was an A1000, a pretty awesome phone. This was around the time that Motorola started releasing the razr which I was far from impressed with. I jumped ship to Sony Erricson and I went through a couple of those before heading over to the wonderful world of HTC. I wanted a smart phone to help with work and so on and I got the HTC HD (If I recall) which was a Windows phone.</p>
<p>While this make me uncomfortable, I was still more comfortable with this than a blackberry. I couldn't get an iPhone for some reason that I cannot remember.</p>
<p>The phone was pretty laggy and I got pretty sick of it pretty quick. I then got myself my first android phone - an HTC Hero... Most people didn't like the curvy bit at the bottom but I didn't care. I was happy to be on the cutting edge. It was also a bit slow and laggy. but it was android and I loved it. It started a brand new love affair... Let me tell you more...</p>
<p><!--more-->This phone got rooted and got all forms on interesting things installed on there. I eventually wanted a phone that was faster and more responsive and opted for the HTC Desire.</p>
<p>Another phone that I loved and it was quicker... and that was nice. I finally had a phone that could compete with the iPhone and did a lot of the things that I wanted it to do. It provided me with the level of flexibility that I wanted.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I rooted that one too and loved it. I wanted the HTC Desire HD when it came out but I had to wait out contract expiries and a good thing it was too.</p>
<p>By the time I was able to get a new phone, I was sick of HTC for various reasons. I had installed a ROM on my phone without HTC Sense and I was surprised at just how much I just did not miss it.</p>
<p>On doing some research, I also realised that HTC had fallen behind and had no "superphones" available.</p>
<p>This led me to the Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Motorola Atrix. It was a tough call for me and for a while, I was seriously considering the S2.</p>
<p>Throwing the question around the office, the Atrix was recommended and without a second thought as such, I went for it. Motorola deserved another shot and I loved their high resolution screens.</p>
<p>My mum got the S2 and someone else I know had it too. I had gotten used to other people having the same phone as me with the Desire, but I love to have something different. The S2 seemed a little flimsy and I like the more solid feeling from the Atrix.</p>
<p>The phone arrived today along with a keyboard, mouse, remote control and a dock. I had a very busy day, so didn't really have a change to play around with the accessories. I'll tell you what though - I remember why I loved Motorola in the first place.</p>
<p>I feel sophisticated and techy with the phone. I love the fingerprint scanner. Its a little laggy and its arguable as to whether its any quicker than punching in the passcode but that's not relevant. Its bloody cool.</p>
<p>And the screen - the screen in absolutely beautiful. Better than HD.</p>
<p>It also come jam packed with some cool applications like Swype. I used to have it a long time ago when it could be purchased.</p>
<p>After it was pulled, I switched to SlideIT which I thoroughly enjoyed. Going to back to Swype though has been beautiful. It just looks and feels much nicer.</p>
<p>There is one complaint in that it still runs Android 2.2. instead of 2.3. Perhaps I shall learn patience. I am not sure if I will root this one. Hopefully I don't quite get bored of it as I did with the HTC's.</p>
<p>I like the bunch of additional stuff that comes with the Motorola phone including the Swype. I'm not convinced that I'll want to give that up.</p>
<p>I'll just wait patiently for the gingerbread upgrade. Until then, I'll just enjoy the other ways in which the device is awfully sweeeeet!</p>
