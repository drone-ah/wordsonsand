According to [Brian Lunduke](http://lunduke.com/?page_id=2){
[Ubuntu 9.10 is almost perfect](http://lunduke.com/?p=815 "Ubuntu 9.10 - almost perfect"){
and I concur.

Being a bit of a purist, I ran [Debian](http://www.debian.org){for very many
years but found their stable releases lagging behind far too much. This was
largely due to their perfectly understandable view of it being ready only when
it is right.

For a while, I ran their unstable distribution
called [Sid](http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/){ based on the disturbed,
hyperactive 10 year old boy in the
film [Toy Story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy%20Story){ The idea being that
Sid breaks things, and it certainly did. While it taught me a heck of a lot
about linux (and the terminal), my computer was broken on a very regular basis.

I switched down to
the [testing version](http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/) and that helped
ease the pain to a very large extent. I had always thought
that [Debian](http://www.debian.org) with a more regular and shorter release
cycle would make a world of difference.
Clearly, [Canonical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical%20Ltd.) had the same
idea.

Thus [Ubuntu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu%20%28Linux%20distribution%29)
was born and it has grown from strength to strength. Its latest distribution
of [9.10 codename karmic koala](http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/910features)
released October 2009, is a massive step forward.

[Stephen](http://www.linkedin.com/in/stepram){ the head
of [krayatec](http://www.krayatec.co.uk){was so impressed by the new release
that he conducted an experiment. He asked three people in the office who are not
tech savvy to install and try out the new release. My view was that it was still
too early for such kind of an adoption. I felt that pushing people to try it out
at this stage would damage the reputation of the user friendliness
of [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) rather than help it.

I must admit that I was proven wrong.  All of the installations went smoothly
and it was possible to log in and do the things that they wanted to do.

Do they now use [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) instead
of [Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft%20Windows) - No! There is
still a learning curve and with tight deadlines and little time for re-learning
how to navigate around a computer, it remains an experiment.

However, it does answer one question. Can a user who is not tech-savvy, pick up
a CD/DVD of the latest version
of [Ubuntu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu%20%28Linux%20distribution%29)
and run with it? The answer, from this very tiny experiment is a resounding Yes!

As someone who is technically very demanding, I have very few complaints about
the latest version. The only one is that it still looks largely the same as the
previous version. Then, the release is a collection of tools, so this is
understandable.

My three favourite things about the new release are:

- substantially faster bootup times
- [Empathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy%20%28software%29) (particular
  for people-nearby which works great in the office)
- [Cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud%20services) (Client & Server)

In my opinion, this is the beginning of the
end. [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), has finally taken a leap that
shows its potential to change everything... I would wish it luck, but it looks
like it doesn't need it ;-)

Why not
[download a live cd](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download "Download Ubuntu Live CD")
and try it out?
