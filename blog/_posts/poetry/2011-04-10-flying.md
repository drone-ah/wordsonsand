As you hold me tight\
Ever so tight\
That I can't breathe\
I feel like a bird\
Flying, soaring, \
Ever so high.

Icarus, such a fool,\
With his wings\
Of wax and feathers

Close to the sun,\
He could not go

For he did not fly \
Simply as I do,

Soar, as I do,

Ever higher I go,\
Closer to the sun,

And all because you love me!
