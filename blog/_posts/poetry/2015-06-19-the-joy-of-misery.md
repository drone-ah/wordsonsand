I want to write of happy things,\
Joyous ocassions,\
Of which there sure are aplenty\
Yet, for some some reason,\
Perhaps a long standing conditioning,\
I keep getting dragged back,\
Back into the mud,\
Into the quicksand,\
A murky swamp\

Why oh why?\
Why is there so much joy,\
In the misery and sorrow?\
In the chewing bubble gum,\
To solve a maths equation.\

Why oh why,\
Do I,\
Am I,\
Do I,\
With little to carry around,\
Worry that I indeed have little,\
I have only this trouble,\
This trouble or that\

I am lacking,\
Not in joy,\
Yes in joy,\
For I am lacking,\
In troubles\
