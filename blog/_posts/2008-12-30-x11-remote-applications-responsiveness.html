<p>As a developer, I use eclipse a lot... We have a powerful server that off which eclipse is run which allows us to keep the desktops at a much lower spec. In general, this works well for us.</p>
<p>However, recently, I have been niggled by the amount of time it takes to switch perspectives on eclipse. It takes a good 4 seconds to switch between perspectives.There is also a noticeable lag when performing some operations.</p>
<p>To resolve this, I spent a lot of time looking at the linux real-time and low-latency patches. I had expected that running X11 applications remotely would not cause a bottleneck over a gigabit link. Turns out that I was wrong.</p>
<p>To test this, I ran a vnc server on the application server and found that switching perspectives on there was super fast.</p>
<p>To be able to resolve this, the first thing to do was to remove any latency put on the X-&gt;X communication by ssh.</p>
<p>We use gdm, so I had to enable to TCP on there first. Do this using the following config line in /etc/gdm/gdm.com</p>
<blockquote><p>DisallowTCP=false</p></blockquote>
<p>Restart gdm</p>
<p>on the remote host, export DISPLAY</p>
<blockquote><p>export DISPLAY=&lt;yourhost&gt;:0</p></blockquote>
<p>and run your application.</p>
<p>I found the application to be a lot more responsive after this. I didn't have to worry about X auth since we have nfs mounted home. If you don't, check <a title="Remote X Apps Mini HowTo" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~zweije/xauth.html" target="_blank">this mini howto</a><br />
