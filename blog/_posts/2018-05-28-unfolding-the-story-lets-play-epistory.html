<p>The other day I stumbled across Origin All Access and saw that it had a bunch of games I wanted to play. One of these was Epistory, which had been in my wishlist for a long time. When trying the game out, I fell in love with it. It is absolutely a treat, so I decided to go through it as part of a let's play.</p>
<h3>#01 - Signal Fires</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A meteor falls from the sky, and everything changes.</p>
<h3>#02 - Forgotten Forest</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We find a dark forest, forgotten and resistant.</p>
<h3>#03 - Cold Shoulder</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We witness another calamity, which once again changes everything.</p>
<h3>#04 - Drowning Halls</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Ice and water in these halls. Do we learn another language?</p>
<h3>#05 - Spark</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We stumble across Chapter 3 and another language</p>
<h3>#06 - Creation City</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Explore the rest of Creation City</p>
<h3>#07 - Ice Mausoleum</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We come across the Ice Mausoleum while exploring and delve into it.</p>
<h3>#08 - Winds of Change</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We run across Chapter 4 while exploring.</p>
<h3>#09 - Shattered Isles</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We go into the shattered isles and discover the fourth language.</body></html></p>
