<p>When I saw the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/644290/MEMORIES_OF_MARS/">game description on steam</a>, I was intrigued. When they were giving out Beta keys, I volunteered and got myself a key. Following are videos put together from maybe around 10 hours of gameplay. Hope you enjoy</p>
<h3>#01 - Exploring Mars</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Random wanderings, musings and exploration of Mars.</p>
<h3>#02 - Building a base</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is mainly the highlights of me figuring out and building a base on Mars :)</p>
<h3>#03 - Beta 1 Highlights</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Highlights from around 6 hours of gameplay over the Beta 1 Weekend.</body></html></p>
