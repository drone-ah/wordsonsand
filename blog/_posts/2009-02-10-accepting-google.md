[Jeff Atwood (Coding
Horror)](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001224.html "Google monoculture"){target="_blank"}
correctly points out that when we refer to search engines, we are really
only referring to one -
[google](http://www.google.co.uk "Google"){target="_blank"}. With its
easy to use, efficient and most importantly effective search
functionality, there really is no reason to use another search engine.

Jeff raises a couple of valid points. With no viable competition, where
is the incentive for them to improve the functionality.Â  It\'s pleasant
to see that google still invests time and money into improving features
including the ability to personalise your search results. However, the
question of how long they will keep doing this is worth asking\...

The more interesting point that Jeff raises is:

My view on this is straightforward. Yes, google is a monopoly on the
search market. There is no viable competition. Yes, it possibly uses
this position in the market to push itself out more and more to the
masses.

However, the reason microsoft got into the bad books (at least for me)
is that while it provided (or provides) fantastic software - it doesn\'t
treat its customers fairly. Budling Internet Explorer with windows is
fine IF it also bundled Netscape/Firefox which was/is a strong
competitor and the only reason people did not use them was lack of
experience / knowledge of the option.

The reason google is successful is because it is the only viable choice.
There is no other option. If Internet Explorer had no competitor. Then,
its fine to include that exclude the others.

Then there is the unfairness in how Microsoft priced the products in
relation to the number of issues / bugs that were in the product. Not to
mention the feeling that, as customers, you were paying for the
privilege of beta testing software.

As a software engineer, I am well aware of the issue around bugs. They
are present, and always will be. That\'s the nature of software. The
issue is not just the number of bugs that are present in software
shipped but also the amount of time it takes to resolve them.

It\'s not the monopolisation of the market that \"got them\". It was
their attitude. The monopolisation of the market was the tool used to
get them. Kinda like Al Capone being arrested for Tax evasion instead of
all the other crimes he commited since that was the only way to get him.
