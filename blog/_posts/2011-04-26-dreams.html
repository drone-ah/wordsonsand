<p>For I once did fall,<br />
For an angel of darkness and light,<br />
As my knees touched rock bottom,<br />
With the  heavy burden of this love I felt..</p>
<p>I realise that she does not love me,<br />
For what she felt me for me,<br />
There is not a word,<br />
Not a phrase, a paragraph or a book.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Even all the words ever written,<br />
All the words ever spoken or thought,<br />
Yet could not describe that...</p>
<p>That undeniable, irrevocable feeling,<br />
That fundamental fibre of her being,<br />
Indescribable to any mortal,<br />
Perhaps even the immortals...</p>
<p>My knees feel the rocks underneath,<br />
And as I look up, I see her,<br />
In all the glory that my mortal eyes can behold...</p>
<p>Her wings spread out,<br />
In all their multicoloured glory...</p>
<p>Her bare feet, with her golden skin,<br />
Glistening in the moonlight...</p>
<p>Her soft golden curls,<br />
Draped over her kind  face,<br />
Glistening in the glory of the sun...</p>
<p>You might know her as life,<br />
Others describe her as fate,<br />
Others yet might know her as destiny...</p>
<p>I did, but only once hear,<br />
That she was described,<br />
As nothing less than the universe...</p>
<p>Walking on this earth,<br />
On the same streets each day,<br />
Past the same buildings,<br />
The same stores,<br />
And the same concrete sidewalks...</p>
<p>The same as I walked on yesterday,<br />
And the day before...</p>
<p>I straighten my back,<br />
And I look up at the sky...</p>
<p>And I feel the tingling sensation,<br />
Just very faintly on my back...</p>
<p>As it grows and sprouts,<br />
Like a tree that has been watered and fed,<br />
Not just for a day or three but decades and centuries...</p>
<p>I feel the wings on my back,<br />
In all its multi-coloured glory...</p>
<p>In a moment of clarity, I realise,<br />
To fly, all one has to do is dream...</p>
<p>And then simply reach for them...</p>
<p></body></html></p>
