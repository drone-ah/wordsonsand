_Skyrim has been modded here to include Frostfall, Imps more complex needs,
alternate start and a few other mods (which should be largely inconsequential to
this log). From alternate start, random was chosen. _

This was not a good start\... Floating in freezing water off the shore of skyrim
somewhere on the way to Solitude\... Brrrr\... Grasping at the strands of
consciousness seemingly content to float away on the freezing waters, I dived in
to find a way out of here.

There was luckily a few things hanging around in the capsized ship, some weapons
and some armour - could be worse. One of the crates also had some snowberry
extract as luck would have it. Swigging it down, dived down again and slowly
traipsed my way out of the ship before the first hit from the extract finished.

Making my way to the bottom of the ship, which was ironically on top, there was
an aldmeri lady on top carrying some stuff, which I conveniently lifted :-D

Now was the hard part, it would seem. I was surrounded by the icy ocean and the
cold breeze did not help much either. Preparing myself mentally, finished off
the last of the snowberry extract, hoped for the best and dived right into the
icy blue seas.

The swim to the shore was not that bad - the snowberry extract kept me going!
Once there, I managed to collect some deadwood and light a fire to dry me off
and warm me up. There really wasn\'t much of anything around - until I spotted a
camp - with a tent and a fire and everything. It was an absolute surprise how it
was missed the first time round - and it looked a lot nicer than the little camp
I put together with deadwood.

I went over there and looked around. There was an Argonian there - and although
I tried to talk to him, he was really not interested.

Looking around, I picked up something that was on one of the barrels, and the
Argonian friend did not take kindly to me snooping around - so I had to kill
him. Hmmmm.. The first drop of blood spilled on this land.. and it was all over
a misunderstanding\... :-/

Anyway, I warmed up a bit there and looked around more to realise that I had to
swim across to another island - and I had no snowberry extract left. Well, the
hard way it will have to be  then. Fortunately, it was a short swim across and I
found a tent on the other side and a little camp which I used to warm up.

After that, a short hop skip and a jump later, I was in Dawnstar\... and
freezing.. As luck would have it, it was night and everything was closed.. it
took me a while, and it seemed like an eternity, but I finally found the inn\...
and warmed myself up\...

As I was falling asleep, it dawned on me that there were a couple of draugr that
I killed in a cave earlier but couldn\'t remember exactly when or where it was -
the cold and the tiredness drifted me off to sleep rather swiftly\...
