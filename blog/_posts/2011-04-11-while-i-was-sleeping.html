<p>As I draw in this breath<br />
I think to myself<br />
By my next breath,<br />
I shall love you<br />
Not any more<br />
For ever more.</p>
<p>As I see the sun set,<br />
I think to myself<br />
By the time the sun rises,<br />
I shall love you,<br />
Not any more<br />
For ever more.</p>

<p>As I see the sun rise,<br />
I think to myself,<br />
By the time the sun sets,<br />
I shall love you,<br />
Not any more,<br />
For ever more.</p>
<p>One more week,<br />
I think to myself,<br />
When this week is over,<br />
I shall love you,<br />
Not any more,<br />
For ever more.</p>
<p>One more month,<br />
I think to myself,<br />
When this month is over,<br />
I shall love you,<br />
Not any more,<br />
For ever more,</p>
<p>Just a year,<br />
I think to myself,<br />
By next year,<br />
I shall love you,<br />
Not any more,<br />
For ever more,</p>
<p>And now I lay,<br />
My life spent,<br />
In trying<br />
Not to love you,<br />
As I draw my last breath,<br />
I think to myself,<br />
When I am born again,<br />
I shall love you,<br />
Not any more,<br />
For ever more.</p>
<p>As I draw my first breath<br />
My first breath of new life,<br />
I think to myself,<br />
I shall love you,<br />
For ever more.</p>
